This week, I looked at my mortgage statement. Monthly payment to the bank. Classic. Routine.

Then I read a report.

And I wondered: how many Palestinian homes did my monthly payment help demolish this month?

## Part One: The Circuit of Clean Dirty Money

### What your banks do while you sleep

Your money never really sleeps. While it sits in your account, your bank invests it. And here's where.

**BNP Paribas Fortis** — Belgium's largest bank — invested **5.7 billion euros** in companies supplying arms and military equipment to the Israeli army between 2021 and 2023[^1]. This is the bank where the Belgian state holds about 5% of shares[^2].

But BNP doesn't stop there. The bank maintains **$32.72 billion** in financial ties with companies active in the Israeli settlement industry — construction, home demolitions, supply of surveillance equipment[^3]. It's the largest European financier of this sector.

**KBC**, the bank that boasts about its sustainability, **increased** its investments in Caterpillar in 2024: **772 million euros**[^3]. Caterpillar, whose D9 bulldozers have been used for decades to raze Palestinian homes, dig mass graves, and turn Gaza into "death zones" according to testimonies from Israeli soldiers published by Breaking the Silence in April 2025[^4].

KBC also purchased, for the first time in years, shares in **Elbit Systems** — the main arms supplier to the Israeli army[^5].

**ING** has lent **$2.16 billion** to arms companies, and **$1.49 billion** to companies involved in settlement construction and home demolitions[^6].

**Belfius** — the bank 100% owned by the Belgian state — provides **$302 million** in financing to companies involved in demolishing Palestinian homes[^7].

Even the **National Bank of Belgium** itself maintains $5 million in investments in companies surveilling Palestinians[^3].

### Nuclear weapons too

It's not just Gaza. The "Don't Bank on the Bomb" report by PAX and ICAN documents that **$314 billion** is invested globally by 298 financial institutions in nuclear weapons producers[^8]. KBC was flagged for a **$72.5 million** loan to Serco, a British company that produces nuclear weapons[^9].

### The silence of the "respectable"

Banks all respond the same way when questioned. BNP Paribas declares that it "always respects laws, rules and conventions" and emphasizes "its commitment to human rights"[^2].

KBC claims to have "the most progressive policy on controversial weapons"[^9].

Meanwhile, the bulldozers keep running.

## Part Two: The Lever We Forgot

### You are the fuel

Banks need two things to function: your deposits (your savings, your current account) and your loan repayments (mortgages, car loans, personal loans).

These regular flows are their oxygen. Without them, their lending and investment system collapses.

You are not powerless. **You are the fuel.**

### The Barclays precedent

In 1970, British students launched a campaign against Barclays Bank, the main investor in apartheid South Africa[^10].

For **16 years**, they did the same thing: close accounts, organize sit-ins at branches, distribute leaflets, challenge shareholder meetings.

Result? In 5 years of intensive campaigning, Barclays lost accounts representing **6 billion pounds** in annual turnover[^10]. In 1986, 15 English local councils closed their accounts. Four Oxford colleges followed. In November 1986, Barclays sold its South African subsidiary[^10].

The campaign worked because it made the cost of inaction higher than the cost of change.

### Strike Debt: the debtors' strike

In the United States, the **Strike Debt** movement was born from Occupy Wall Street in 2012. Their finding: **one in seven Americans** is being pursued by collection agents. Adding mortgage defaults and student loans, probably **a quarter of indebted Americans are already in default**[^11].

Anthropologist David Graeber put it this way: "You have 75 to 90 million people who are already practicing civil disobedience against financial capital — but they don't want anyone to know"[^11].

Strike Debt transformed individual shame into collective action. Their "Rolling Jubilee" bought and erased **more than $32 million** in medical and student debt[^12]. In 2020, during the pandemic, the Debt Collective organized **1,600 debtors** to simultaneously defer their loan repayments[^13].

The principle is simple: **alone, a late payment is a personal problem. Together, it's political pressure.**

## Part Three: The Hashtags of Revolt

### The idea

One month. Just one month.

Thousands of Belgian citizens, the same month, suspend repayment of their loan — mortgage, personal, auto. Not a permanent default. A one-month delay, coordinated, visible, claimed.

With a clear message:

> **"We will not finance bulldozers that demolish homes. We will not finance bombs. Exit the arms industry, or we continue."**

### The names of the movement

To bypass algorithmic filters and shadowbans, the movement uses **multiple interchangeable hashtags**:

- **#ThisMonthIDontPayMyLoan** — The original, direct
- **#IDONTPAYMYLOAN** — Condensed version
- **#NEMESISBANK** — Divine vengeance against banks
- **#DEFAULTDAY** — Collective default day
- **#BankBoycott2026** — Explicit and dated
- **#DebtStrike** — In line with Strike Debt
- **#MyLoanMyChoice** — Ironic twist
- **#PaymentPause** — Soft version for the timid
- **#NotMyBulldozer** — The link to demolitions

Use them all. Alternate. Algorithms can't block them all.

### Why it would work

1. **The mass effect** — One individual delay, the bank doesn't care. Ten thousand simultaneous delays is an alarm signal in risk management systems.

2. **Visibility** — A coordinated action with multiple hashtags generates media attention. Banks hate negative media attention.

3. **Reputational cost** — Banks invest millions in their "sustainable" and "ethical" image. Every article documenting their arms investments erodes that facade.

4. **Repeatability** — If one month isn't enough, we do it again. The anti-Barclays campaign lasted 16 years. We have time.

### The demands

Concrete. Verifiable. Progressive.

1. **Immediate publication** of investments in the arms industry
2. **Total divestment** from companies supplying arms to countries committing documented violations of international humanitarian law
3. **Adoption of exclusion policies** in accordance with the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW)

## Part Four: What You Need to Know Before Deciding

### The risks — let's be honest

Civil disobedience has a cost. You need to know it before choosing.

**Registration with the Central Credit Register (CCP)** — In Belgium, after 2 to 3 unpaid monthly payments, the lender is required to report the default to the National Bank of Belgium[^14]. You are then registered in the "negative section" of the CCP.

**Consequences of registration**:
- Difficulty obtaining new credit while registered
- If registered for more than 1,000 euros in debt, legal prohibition on lending you money[^15]
- Registration for **1 year after regularization** if you repay
- Registration for up to **10 years** if you don't regularize[^14]

**Late interest** — Late payment interest rates in Belgium reached record levels in 2023-2025 due to inflation[^16].

**Collection procedures** — Reminder letters, formal notices, and potentially wage garnishment[^14].

### How to minimize risks

1. **One month only, then regularization** — A one-month delay, followed by full payment (monthly payment + interest), generally does not trigger registration (which requires 2-3 monthly payments)[^14].

2. **Prior communication** — Informing your bank in writing of the reason for the delay (documented civil disobedience action) creates a record and may facilitate negotiation.

3. **Visible collective action** — The more massive and publicized the action, the more banks will be incentivized to negotiate rather than prosecute.

4. **Solidarity fund** — The Strike Debt movement created mutual funds to help participants in difficulty. We could do the same.

### Who can participate (and who shouldn't)

**Can participate**: Anyone with a current loan and sufficient financial margin to absorb late interest and regularize quickly.

**Should not participate**: People already in a fragile financial situation, already registered with the CCP, or for whom an additional delay would create a risk of insolvency.

**This is an act of civil disobedience, not financial suicide.** Everyone assesses their own risks.

## Part Five: The Moral Precedent

### Illegitimate debt

David Graeber, in *Debt: The First 5,000 Years*, recalls that debt cancellation — the "jubilee" — is a millennia-old practice inscribed in Jewish, Christian, and Islamic traditions[^11]. When debt becomes unsustainable or unjust, civilizations have always canceled it.

Iceland did it after the 2008 crisis: instead of bailing out banks, it canceled part of household debts[^12].

### Moral complicity

Francesca Albanese, UN Special Rapporteur for Human Rights in the Occupied Palestinian Territories, writes in the preface to the 11.11.11 and FairFin report:

> "Banks and companies fundamentally contribute to the oppression of Palestinians. Their complicity must no longer be seen as a simple matter of occupation, but of participation in an entire regime of apartheid, occupation and genocide."[^5]

If our banks are complicit, and if our money feeds these banks, then **our silence is also a form of complicity**.

### The choice

There are banks that do otherwise. In Belgium, **vdk bank**, **Triodos** and others have adopted policies of total exclusion from the arms industry and explicitly refer to the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons[^17].

Changing banks is an option. But it's not enough to change the system. We also need to **put pressure on the giants** — BNP Paribas, KBC, ING — to make them change.

## The question I leave you with

This is not a call to act without thinking. It's a question.

Your signature at the bottom of your loan agreement — is it also a ballot? A vote for or against bulldozers? For or against bombs?

If the answer is yes, then the next question is: **what are you going to do with that ballot?**

**Do we still have levers? Are we ready to use them?**

The garden is large. The roots extend further than we think. And sometimes, you have to shake the tree to see what falls.
