I dreamed of holes in the skin. Something was gnawing at the flesh, at calf level — where the body carries, where it moves forward. Searching for the cause, I found a scarab. Like in *The Mummy*: ancient, sacred, unsettling. But when I tried to crush it, the truth revealed itself.

It wasn't a scarab. It was a small robot.

## The Appearance of the Sacred

The scarab, in ancient Egypt, is Khepri — the god of rebirth, of self-generation. The one who creates himself anew each morning. A symbol of transformation and renewal.

It's also, in cinematic imagination, the creature that devours from within. That slips under the skin and gnaws, invisible, while the surface remains intact.

When you confront it — when you dare to seize it and look closely — you discover it has nothing sacred about it. It's a machine. A mechanism. A tool programmed to gnaw.

## Rabota

The word *robot* comes from Czech *robota*: forced labor, drudgery, servitude. Karel Čapek invented it in 1920 to designate enslaved artificial beings. In Russian, *работа* — *rabota* — simply means "work." Same root. Same idea: mechanical labor, without consciousness, without choice.

And *root*, precisely. The robot gnaws at the root. It creates nothing, transforms nothing — it consumes. It imitates the living to better parasitize it.

## The World's Calves

Why calves? Because calves carry the body. Without them, no walking, no progress, no circulation.

There exists a geographic corridor that functions exactly like calves for world trade: the Red Sea. To the north, the Suez Canal — vital artery between Europe and Asia. To the south, the Bab el-Mandeb strait — whose Arabic name means "the gate of lamentations."

Between the two: Sudan, torn apart by civil war where foreign mercenaries have deeply embedded themselves — gold mines, militia support, naval base negotiations. And across the water, Yemen, where factions have been disrupting maritime traffic for years.

Something is gnawing at the world's calves.

## The Disguise

Seen from afar, the destabilization of this region looks like organic chaos. Civil wars, tribal tensions, religious movements. The sacred scarab: ancient, rooted, almost natural.

But when you seize the thing — when you look at who finances, who arms, who trains, who profits — you discover the robot. The mechanical. The programmed. Strategic *rabota* serving interests that have nothing to do with local peoples.

The discourse is also a disguise. "We come to liberate you." "We protect you from the West." "We respect your sovereignty." The trappings of the sacred — the civilizing mission, geopolitical messianism — cover a mechanism of predation. Theomania in service of rabota.

## The Act of Confronting

In the dream, it's by trying to crush the scarab that its true nature reveals itself. Not before. As long as it operates silently under the skin, it passes for living. It passes for sacred.

It's direct confrontation that forces the unveiling.

Naming things for what they are — not local conflicts but mechanical operations, not the sacred but servitude, not roots but robots — that's the first gesture. The gesture that transforms the invisible parasite into an identifiable, manipulable, crushable object.

The scarab was a robot. It's time to say it.

## Postscript: Fatima

There exists a prophecy that speaks of Russia as the source of the world's ills — that of Fatima, 1917. The very year the Bolsheviks took power. The year *rabota* became state doctrine.

A century later, the world's calves still bleed. And beneath the sacred scarabs, if you look closely, you always find the same machinery.
