This week, I opened two history books side by side. One about France, the other about the United States. And I saw the same film, with different actors but an identical script: parties born on the left that end up on the right, parties already on the right that drift further still, and elites from both camps who end up looking strangely alike.

This is not a coincidence. It is a structural pattern. And it deserves to be unearthed.

## France: the left that devours itself

The story begins in 1905. The SFIO (French Section of the Workers' International) is born from the unification of France's socialist families, under the impetus of Jean Jaurès. The programme is Marxist: abolition of capitalism, collective ownership of the means of production, internationalism[^1].

Fast forward. In 1981, François Mitterrand is elected on a platform of rupture: nationalisations, retirement at 60, a fifth week of paid leave. Two years later, the *tournant de la rigueur* (austerity turn) of 1983 marks the abandonment of economic voluntarism in favour of budgetary discipline and European integration[^1]. The left in power chooses monetary stability over stimulus.

Under Lionel Jospin (1997–2002), the "plural left" government privatises more than the right-wing governments that preceded it: France Télécom, Thomson, Eramet, the motorways. Then comes François Hollande (2012–2017): the CICE — a €40 billion tax credit for businesses — and the Labour Law, carried by a socialist government against its own voters[^2].

The word "socialist" remained on the poster. The content changed entirely.

On the other side, social Gaullism fared no better. De Gaulle was a planner: employee participation, regional development, national independence. Chaban-Delmas proposed in 1969 a "New Society" that looked like unabashed social democracy[^3]. But from 1986 onward, Jacques Chirac embraced neoliberalism (privatisations, deregulation), and Nicolas Sarkozy completed the transformation by combining economic liberalism with identity politics[^4].

Meanwhile, the French Communist Party — 28% of the vote in 1946, over 800,000 members — collapsed. The orphaned working-class vote migrated to the Front National[^14]. This is what Badinter, then Tévanian and Tissot, called the "lepenisation of minds": the FN's themes (immigration, security, national identity) contaminated the discourse of the entire political class, left and right alike[^6].

## United States: Lincoln's party votes Trump

The Republican Party is founded in 1854 on a single watchword: opposition to the expansion of slavery. Abraham Lincoln, the first Republican president, wages the Civil War to preserve the Union and abolish slavery. Teddy Roosevelt (1901–1909) busts the trusts and creates national parks. Dwight Eisenhower (1953–1961) applies a 91% marginal tax rate on the highest incomes and launches the national highway system. Richard Nixon creates the EPA (Environmental Protection Agency)[^7].

Then comes the Southern Strategy. Kevin Phillips, a Nixon strategist, theorises in 1969 that Republicans can conquer the Deep South by capturing the racial resentment of white voters disillusioned by civil rights legislation[^4]. The calculation works. Ronald Reagan (1981–1989) transforms the party: massive tax cuts for the wealthy, deregulation, a culture war against "Big Government"[^5]. The Tea Party further radicalises the movement in the 2010s. Donald Trump is its logical culmination.

The party that freed the slaves became the party that refuses to acknowledge the existence of systemic racism.

On the Democratic side, the path is a mirror image. The party of nineteenth-century slaveholders reinvents itself under Franklin Roosevelt with the New Deal (1933–1938): social security, public works, financial regulation. Lyndon Johnson signs the Civil Rights Acts in 1964–1965, reportedly confiding to an aide: "We have just delivered the South to the Republican Party for a generation"[^8].

Then comes Bill Clinton (1993–2001) and "triangulation": the Third Way. Clinton reforms welfare, signs NAFTA, repeals the Glass-Steagall Act (which had separated commercial and investment banking since 1933), and deregulates the derivatives markets[^9][^10]. The party of the New Deal becomes the party of Wall Street.

And the Overton window shifts. Eisenhower's positions — high tax rates, massive public investment, suspicion of the military-industrial complex — would be labelled "far left" in today's American debate[^11].

## The horizontal elites

Here is the phenomenon that political scientists have been documenting for years: the leaders of left-wing and right-wing parties, despite their opposing rhetoric, converge sociologically.

Thomas Piketty, Amory Gethin, and Clara Martínez-Toledano have shown that Western democracies are now governed by a "dual elite" system: the "Brahmin Left" (educated, urban, culturally progressive) and the "Merchant Right" (wealthy, economically liberal)[^7]. The working classes are represented by neither camp.

Robert Michels predicted this as early as 1911 with his "iron law of oligarchy": every democratic organisation, whatever its starting ideology, inevitably tends toward the concentration of power in the hands of a ruling minority[^8].

Peter Mair, in *Ruling the Void* (2013), goes further: parties are no longer transmission belts between society and the state, but quasi-state agencies that manage power for themselves. The "void" between citizens and leaders grows wider[^9].

Chantal Mouffe completes the picture: by suppressing the left-right conflict in the name of "consensus" and "good governance," political elites do not make antagonisms disappear — they repress them. And that repression feeds populism[^10].

## The pattern repeats

In Episode 01, I identified five stages in the life of political movements:

1. **Birth in urgency** — a glaring injustice, idealistic founders.
2. **Conquest of power** — the movement organises and wins.
3. **Institutionalisation** — permanent staff, offices, compromises.
4. **Management replaces vision** — defending gains instead of conquering new ground.
5. **The words remain, the meaning evaporates** — labels stay on bottles whose contents have changed.

Today's episode reveals two additional stages:

6. **Elite convergence** — the leaders of opposing camps end up sharing the same class interests, the same networks, the same lifestyles. Political conflict becomes a spectacle that masks class solidarity at the top[^12][^15].

7. **The vacuum effect** — the people, abandoned by their natural representatives, turn toward populisms that promise to "give the people their voice back." The loop closes: a new movement is born from genuine suffering, and the cycle begins again[^13].

## This is not an indictment

Some of these changes are legitimate adaptations. Jaurès's world is not the world of 2026. Governing requires compromises. Social democracy lifted millions out of poverty before running out of steam.

But the factual observation remains: the words "progressive," "freedom," "social justice" no longer mean what they once meant. And when political language loses its anchor in reality, democracy itself erodes[^11].

Colin Crouch calls this "post-democracy": a system where democratic institutions still function formally, but real decisions are made elsewhere — in boardrooms, lobbying firms, and dinners among elites[^11].

## The question I leave you with

Is this drift reversible? Can we refill words with their original meaning, or do we need to invent new ones?

Episode 01 posed the question for Belgium. This one extends it to France and the United States. The pattern holds: it crosses borders.

Write to me. The garden is vast, and the roots reach further than we think.
