Dear Privilegist,

I write to you from beneath the dandelion. From where you never look — where roots work in darkness so that the flower appears to emerge from nowhere, as if by magic, as if by merit.

You probably won't read me. Your time is counted in units more precious than the words of a gardener. But I write anyway, because that's what roots do: they grow, even when no one is watching.

## The coroner who foresees the murder

I've understood your trade, Sir. Not the one you declare — advisor, administrator, philanthropist — but the one you actually practice: **architect of the emergency exit**.

You don't commit the crimes. You draft the exceptions that make them possible. You don't steal the money. You design the circuits that make it disappear. You don't oppress anyone directly. You build the structures where oppression becomes "standard procedure."

The ordinary coroner notes death after the fact. You foresee the murder before it's committed — and you draft the death certificate that will conclude: natural causes.

It's an art, I admit. The art of hermeticism.

## Hermes, the god of thieves

You like the word, don't you? "Hermetic." It evokes mystery, initiation, knowledge reserved for the worthy. Hermes Trismegistus, ancient wisdom, spiritual alchemy.

But Hermes was also the god of thieves. Of merchants. Of borders crossed unseen. Of messages carried without understanding — and above all, without revealing.

Your hermeticism is not that of the mystic. It's that of the safe. The secret that protects itself. The decontamination chamber between consequences and their architects.

When the scandal breaks — and it always breaks, sooner or later — you're already on the other side of the door. The fuse has blown. The fall guy has been sacrificed. The "little hands" have been shown to the cameras. And you chair the inquiry commission that will conclude "systemic dysfunctions" — without ever naming the system.

## The architecture of the farce

In previous episodes of this column, I documented how words are emptied of their meaning. "Freedom" no longer frees. "Solidarity" is no longer solidary. "Social justice" has lost both justice and the social.

But I thought then of a drift — a gradual slide, erosion through use. I was wrong.

It's not a drift, Sir. It's an architecture.

You don't let words empty themselves. You hollow them out. Methodically. You keep the packaging and replace the contents. The customer thinks they're buying what they've always bought. They don't check. Why would they? The label is the same.

And when someone checks — when someone opens the bottle and says "this isn't wine anymore, it's vinegar" — you've prepared the response. The taste has evolved. Palates have refined. It's an exceptional vintage, reserved for connoisseurs. Those who protest are nostalgics, populists, people who haven't understood the complexity of the modern world.

The farce was written before the curtain rose.

## The will before the inheritance

I return to the title of my first episode: "Heirs Without a Testament." I wondered what the founders of parties would say if they saw their heirs.

But the real question, I ask it now: **what if the founders had been, themselves, privilegists?**

Not all of them. Not always. Some sincerely believed in the words they spoke. But among them, from the beginning, there were those who knew. Those who drafted the constitution with its trapdoors. Those who voted for the law with its exceptions. Those who founded the institution with its blind spots.

The will was written before the inheritance was constituted. The legitimate heirs were designated in advance — and they weren't the ones shown on the posters.

## What you cannot seal

Dear Privilegist, I don't accuse you. I describe you. That's different.

You're not a monster. You're a craftsman. You do what your position allows you to do, what your education taught you to do, what your network encourages you to do. You're rational. You optimize. You protect your own.

Like everyone else, you'll say.

No. Not like everyone else. Because "your own" is a circle you have the power to draw. And you always draw it a little smaller than it appears. Large enough to include useful allies. Small enough to exclude consequences.

But here's what you cannot seal, Sir:

The dandelion grows back. Always. You can concrete over the garden. You can poison the soil. You can pay gardeners to pull up every shoot as soon as it appears. But somewhere, in a crack in the concrete, a seed waits. And the root, that thing you despise because it works in darkness without ever reaching the light — the root digs.

It digs from beneath.

And one day, Sir, your hermeticism will be nothing but a word in an etymological dictionary, a historical curiosity, the trace of an era when some believed they could seal the future.

On that day, the roots will still be there.

I greet you without cordiality but without hatred,

## Postscript to the reader

This episode has no sources. Not because facts are lacking — the three previous episodes are full of them. But because this text is something else: an open letter to a function, not a person; a meditation on a mechanism, not an indictment of individuals.

If you're looking for names, dates, amounts — reread episodes 1, 2, and 3. The privilegists appear there, but always obliquely, always in the shadow of the structures they built.

That's their talent. That's their hermeticism.

That's what the roots, slowly, undo.
