This week, I fell down an etymological rabbit hole. It happens to me quite often — I pull on a thread and three hours later I find myself staring at a ball of yarn that looks back at me accusingly.

The thread, this time, was a suffix. Four letters: *-phobe*. I laid them next to what they claim to describe. And it didn't fit. Not at all.

Words have a memory, and that memory reaches back to Ancient Greek. And Ancient Greek does not lie. We, on the other hand — we lie with its pieces.

## Part One: The strategic invention of an imperfect word

### George Weinberg and the stroke of genius of 1965

In 1965, American psychologist George Weinberg observed something disturbing among his colleagues. When he invited gay friends to gatherings, some of his fellow psychologists reacted with visceral aversion — "no argument, just repugnance," he would later say.[^1]

Weinberg understood that the problem was not with homosexuals. The problem lay with those who looked at them. And to name it, he coined a word: *homophobia*.

The term first appeared in the press in 1969, in the magazine *Screw*, then in *Time Magazine* the same year.[^2] In 1972, Weinberg developed it in *Society and the Healthy Homosexual*, a revolutionary book whose opening sentence set the tone: "I would never consider a patient healthy unless he had overcome his prejudice against homosexuality."[^3]

The stroke of genius was strategic: by attaching the suffix *-phobia* to anti-gay prejudice, Weinberg reversed the diagnosis. It was no longer the homosexual who was sick — it was the one persecuting them. At a time when homosexuality was still listed in the *Diagnostic and Statistical Manual* (DSM) as a psychiatric disorder, this reversal was an act of intellectual resistance.[^3]

### A word aware of its own limits

But Weinberg knew his word was imperfect. He defined it narrowly: "the dread of being in close quarters with homosexuals — and in the case of homosexuals themselves, self-loathing."[^3]

The word worked — magnificently — as a political tool. It helped remove homosexuality from the DSM in 1973. It gave a name to something everyone could see but no one could name.[^2]

But sixty years on, the word has become our prison.

## Part Two: The etymological lie

### What Greek actually says

The suffix *-phobos* (φόβος) denotes fear, flight, instinctive aversion.[^4] The arachnophobe flees the spider. The claustrophobe flees the enclosed space. The agoraphobe flees the crowd. In every case, the mechanism is identical: a terror that drives avoidance, withdrawal, paralysis.

Now, what does the person called "homophobic" actually do?

They do not flee. They do not cower. They do not cross the street trembling. No. They legislate. They harass. They assault. They stalk. They march, petition, preach and persecute. They invite themselves into other people's bedrooms with the relentlessness of the zealot. They devote considerable energy to scrutinising, commenting on, condemning and attempting to control the intimacy of perfect strangers.

This behaviour is not a phobia. It is an obsession.

### Science confirms: it is not fear

Gregory Herek, professor of psychology at the University of California, Davis, and one of the world's foremost experts on sexual prejudice, has spent decades documenting the term's limitations. In a landmark 2004 article, "Beyond Homophobia," he noted that the word "only rarely refers to an intense, irrational fear of sexual minorities," that it "is framed through the lens of psychopathology without being intended as a diagnosis," and that it "has insufficiently reflected the role of broader social norms in shaping individual attitudes."[^5]

Herek proposed replacing the term with "sexual prejudice," which he defined as "negative attitudes toward an individual based on their sexual orientation."[^6] More precise. But still not quite right.

Because the problem is not merely imprecision. It is the direction of the spotlight.

### The rhetorical shield

In 2012, the Associated Press — whose *Stylebook* sets editorial standards for most American newspapers — dropped the word "homophobia" from political and social contexts. Deputy standards editor Dave Minthorn explained: "It's just inaccurate. It's ascribing a mental disability to someone, and suggests a knowledge that we don't have."[^7]

Weinberg himself opposed this removal, arguing that the word remained "crucial to our humanity" as long as the acts it described persisted.[^8] He was right about the need to name. But the question remains: to name wrongly — is that not to inadvertently protect?

For here is what the suffix *-phobe* allows: any persecutor can answer "I'm not afraid," and be technically correct. The word offers them a linguistic escape hatch.

Worse still: it creates a perverse incentive for aggression. If you are accused of being afraid, how do you prove otherwise? By showing you are not afraid. By approaching the supposed object of your terror. By hitting, insulting, persecuting — precisely to demonstrate that you are not the person the word claims to describe. Phobia calls for flight; the refutation of phobia calls for attack. The word does not describe the violence — it provokes it.

And by attaching *homo-* to a negative suffix, it subtly locates the problem on the homosexual's side — as though merely existing were enough to trigger a pathology in the other.

## Part Three: The correct diagnosis — mania

### A far more precise suffix

Ancient Greek offers us another tool: *-mania* (μανία) — madness, devouring obsession, the compulsive fixation that consumes reason.[^4] The pyromaniac does not "fear" fire: they are possessed by it. The megalomaniac does not "flee" grandeur: they are enslaved by it. The kleptomaniac does not "dread" theft: they are imprisoned by it.

The *homomaniac* does not fear homosexuality: they are consumed by it. They think about it in the morning reading the newspaper. They think about it when they see two people holding hands in the street. They think about it when voting, when raising their children, when choosing their political battles. Their mind is colonised by other people's homosexuality with an intensity that most gay people themselves probably never reach.

### The science of obsession

In 1996, psychologists Henry Adams, Lester Wright and Bethany Lohr at the University of Georgia published a now-famous study in the *Journal of Abnormal Psychology*. They measured the physiological responses of 64 heterosexual men — 35 classified as "homophobic" and 29 as "non-homophobic" — when exposed to homosexual erotic stimuli. Result: only the homophobic men showed significant sexual arousal in response to male homosexual stimuli.[^9]

The interpretations of this study are debated — arousal might reflect anxiety rather than desire.[^9] But what the study documents unambiguously is a disproportionate reactivity: the "homophobe" does not look away. Their body reacts. Their attention is captured. This is the mechanism of obsessive fixation, not of phobia.

### The triple advantage of the new term

The term *homomaniac* offers a triple advantage:

1. **Etymologically accurate**: it describes an obsession, not a fear.
2. **Clinically honest**: the psychological literature has extensively documented the compulsive and projective dimension of these behaviours.[^9][^10]
3. **Rhetorically just**: it redirects the spotlight to where the dysfunction truly lies — with the persecutor, not the persecuted. The homomaniac carries the diagnosis in their own name.

## Part Four: The generalisation — discriminatory manias

### A pattern that repeats

What we observe regarding homosexuality holds true for the full spectrum of discrimination. Everywhere, the suffix *-phobe* masks the reality of the behaviour.

The *xenomaniac* is not afraid of foreigners — they are obsessed with their presence. They see them everywhere, blame them for everything, build entire political programmes on this fixation. They spend more time talking about foreigners than foreigners themselves spend thinking about them.

The *ethnomaniac* does not tremble before a skin colour — they scrutinise it, categorise it, rank it with the meticulousness of the compulsive collector.

The *transmaniac* does not flee transgender people — they invest disproportionate time and energy in policing their bodies, their identity documents, their toilets.

The *Islamomaniac* does not flee Muslims — they track them, comment on them, surveil them, fantasise about them, invoke them at every debate as though all of civilisation depended on what a woman wears on her head.

In every case, the same structure: not fearful avoidance, but an obsessive fixation that devours the attention, discourse and political action of the maniac.

### Who benefits from the wrong diagnosis?

Previous episodes of the Roots' Garden posed the question: *cui bono* — who benefits from the crime? Let us apply it here.

Who benefits from the suffix *-phobe*?

Certainly not the victims, who find themselves linguistically associated with a negative word. Certainly not public debate, which loses precision. Certainly not psychology, which sees one of its clinical suffixes misappropriated.

It benefits the persecutor, who can deflect: "I'm not afraid." It benefits systems of oppression, which remain unnamed: if it is an individual "phobia," it is not a social structure. And it benefits all those who prefer to pathologise individuals rather than question systems.

## Part Five: Heterophobia — the true name of the root

### The common trunk

It remains to name the common trunk of all these manias. And here, a word already exists, whose etymology contains a magnificent irony: *heterophobia*.

*Heteros* (ἕτερος) means in Greek "the other," "the different," "that which is not identical to oneself."[^4] *Phobos*, fear. Heterophobia is therefore, in the most literal sense, the fear of otherness — the existential terror of that which differs from oneself.

And here, the suffix *-phobia* finally recovers its accuracy. For beneath the noisy mania, beneath the laws and insults and violence, there is indeed a fear. A deep fear, often unacknowledged, sometimes unconscious: the fear of a world that does not conform to the reassuring image one has built of it. The fear that the other, by their mere existence, might call into question the solidity of one's own certainties.

The heterophobe — the one who fears difference in all its forms — is the common soil of racism, sexism, homomania, xenomania. Fear is the root; mania is the active symptom.

### The complete structure

```
HETEROPHOBIA (root)
    Existential fear of otherness
           |
           v
    DISCRIMINATORY MANIAS (symptoms)
    |-- Homomania: obsession with others' sexual orientation
    |-- Xenomania: obsession with others' origins
    |-- Ethnomania: obsession with others' skin colour
    |-- Transmania: obsession with others' gender identity
    |-- Islamomania: obsession with others' religion
    +-- etc.
           |
           v
    SYSTEMS OF OPPRESSION (structures)
    |-- Heterosexism: system of heterosexual privilege
    |-- Racism: system of racial hierarchy
    |-- Patriarchy: system of male domination
    +-- etc.
```

This architecture distinguishes three levels that the current vocabulary conflates:

1. **Fear** (heterophobia) — deep psychological level, often unconscious
2. **Obsession** (manias) — visible, compulsive behavioural level
3. **System** (structures of oppression) — institutional, cultural level

To confuse these levels is to deprive ourselves of the means to fight them effectively.

## Part Six: Episode 01 in reverse

### The link with the series

In Episode 01 of the Roots' Garden, we documented the semantic drift of political parties: words that remained on bottles whose contents had changed. "Freedom," "solidarity," "social justice" — the labels endured; the meaning evaporated.

Here, we observe the inverse phenomenon: words that never had the right content. Not a drift — a foundational error. The word "homophobia" has not drifted from its original meaning. It was built on an ill-suited suffix, for strategically understandable reasons whose consequences have now caught up with us.

It is the same lesson, seen from the other side of the mirror: vocabulary is never innocent. When words lie — by drift or by construction — they protect the structures they claim to name.

### The persecutor is a coward who does not know it

This analysis is not merely a lexical exercise. To name correctly is to understand correctly. And to understand correctly is to be able to act with precision.

When we say "homophobe," we describe an enemy. When we say "homomaniac," we describe someone obsessed. When we identify heterophobia as the root, we describe a coward. And facing a coward, the response is not the same as facing an enemy.

The discriminatory maniac is someone whose identity is so fragile that it cannot withstand the existence of otherness. Their obsession with the other is merely the inverted reflection of their anxiety about themselves. Every law they vote against difference is an admission of insecurity. Every insult is a cry of panic. Every persecution is a desperate attempt to simplify a world whose complexity overwhelms them.

This makes their actions no less grave, no less condemnable. But it changes the way we see the mechanism. And in that change of perspective lies perhaps, beyond the necessary resistance, a key to understanding — and therefore to transformation.

For one cannot cure a mania by calling it a phobia. And one cannot fight fear by pretending it does not exist.

---

### The question I leave you with

Do the words we use to describe discrimination truly describe it? Or do they form one more screen between us and reality?

If vocabulary protects what it claims to combat, then the first act of resistance may be to rename. Not out of linguistic vanity. Because you cannot heal what you cannot name.

Write to me. The garden is large, and some roots are buried in language itself.
