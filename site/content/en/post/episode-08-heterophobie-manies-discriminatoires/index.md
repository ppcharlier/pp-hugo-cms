This week, I fell down an etymological rabbit hole. It happens often — I pull a thread and find myself three hours later with a ball of yarn staring back at me accusingly.

The thread, this time, was a suffix. Four letters: *-phobe*. I placed them next to what they claim to describe. And it didn't fit. Not at all.

Words have a memory, and this one goes back to ancient Greek. And ancient Greek doesn't lie. We, however — we lie with its pieces.

## Part One: The Strategic Invention of an Imperfect Word

### George Weinberg and the stroke of genius of 1965

In 1965, American psychologist George Weinberg observed something troubling among his colleagues. When he invited gay friends to gatherings, some colleagues reacted with visceral aversion — "without argument, just repugnance," he would later say.[^1]

Weinberg understood that the problem wasn't with homosexuals. The problem was with those looking at them. And to name it, he invented a word: *homophobia*.

The term first appeared in print in 1969, in *Screw* magazine, then in *Time Magazine* the same year.[^2] In 1972, Weinberg developed it in *Society and the Healthy Homosexual*, a revolutionary book whose first sentence sets the tone: "I would never consider a patient healthy unless he had overcome his prejudice against homosexuality."[^3]

The stroke of genius was strategic: by attaching the suffix *-phobia* to anti-gay prejudice, Weinberg reversed the diagnosis. It was no longer the homosexual who was sick — it was the persecutor. At a time when homosexuality was still listed in the *Diagnostic and Statistical Manual* (DSM) as a psychiatric pathology, this reversal was an act of intellectual resistance.[^3]

### A word aware of its limits

But Weinberg knew his word was imperfect. He defined it narrowly: "the dread of being in close quarters with homosexuals — and in the case of homosexuals themselves, self-loathing."[^3]

The word worked — magnificently — as a political tool. It helped get homosexuality removed from the DSM in 1973. It gave a name to something everyone saw but nobody could name.[^2]

But sixty years later, the word imprisons us.

## Part Two: The Etymological Lie

### What Greek really says

The suffix *-phobos* (φόβος) denotes fear, flight, instinctive aversion.[^4] The arachnophobe flees the spider. The claustrophobe flees enclosed spaces. The agoraphobe flees crowds. In each case, the mechanism is identical: a terror that drives avoidance, withdrawal, paralysis.

But what does the person called "homophobe" do?

He doesn't flee. He doesn't cower. He doesn't change sidewalks trembling. No. He legislates. He harasses. He assaults. He hunts. He demonstrates, petitions, preaches and persecutes. He invites himself into other people's bedrooms with the obstinacy of a fanatic. He devotes considerable energy to scrutinizing, commenting, condemning and trying to control the intimacy of perfect strangers.

This behaviour is not a phobia. It's an obsession.

### Science confirms: it's not fear

Gregory Herek, psychology professor at the University of California, Davis, and one of the world's leading experts on sexual prejudice, has spent decades documenting the term's limitations. In a foundational 2004 article, "Beyond Homophobia," he notes that the word "rarely refers to intense and irrational fear of sexual minorities," that it "is framed through the lens of psychopathology without being designed as a diagnosis," and that it "has insufficiently reflected the role of broader social norms in shaping individual attitudes."[^5]

Herek proposes replacing the term with "sexual prejudice," which he defines as "negative attitudes toward an individual because of their sexual orientation."[^6] It's more precise. But it's still not quite right.

Because the problem isn't just imprecision. It's the direction of the spotlight.

### The rhetorical shield

In 2012, the Associated Press — whose *Stylebook* sets editorial standards for most American newspapers — removed the word "homophobia" from political and social contexts. Deputy managing editor Dave Minthorn explained: "It's simply inaccurate. It's ascribing a mental disorder to someone, and it suggests knowledge we don't have."[^7]

Weinberg himself opposed this removal, arguing that the word remained "crucial to our humanity" as long as the acts it describes persisted.[^8] He was right about the need to name. But the question remains: is naming wrongly not inadvertently protecting?

For here's what the suffix *-phobe* allows: any persecutor can respond "I'm not afraid," and be technically correct. The word offers them a linguistic escape route.

Worse still: it creates a perverse incentive for aggression. If you're accused of being afraid, how do you prove otherwise? By showing you're not afraid. By approaching the supposed object of your terror. By striking, insulting, persecuting — precisely to demonstrate that you're not what the word claims to describe. Phobia calls for flight; refutation of phobia calls for attack. The word doesn't describe violence — it provokes it.

## Part Three: The Correct Diagnosis — Mania

### A far more precise suffix

Ancient Greek offers us another tool: *-mania* (μανία) — madness, devouring obsession, compulsive fixation that consumes reason.[^4] The pyromaniac doesn't "fear" fire: he's possessed by it. The megalomaniac doesn't "flee" grandeur: he's enslaved by it. The kleptomaniac doesn't "dread" theft: he's prisoner to it.

The homomaniac doesn't fear homosexuality: he's obsessed with it. He thinks about it in the morning reading the newspaper. He thinks about it seeing two people hold hands in the street. He thinks about it when voting, when raising his children, when choosing his political battles. His mind is colonized by others' homosexuality with an intensity that most homosexuals themselves probably don't reach.

### The science of obsession

In 1996, psychologists Henry Adams, Lester Wright and Bethany Lohr of the University of Georgia published a now-famous study in the *Journal of Abnormal Psychology*. They measured the physiological reactions of 64 heterosexual men — 35 classified as "homophobic" and 29 as "non-homophobic" — to homosexual erotic stimuli. Result: only the homophobic men showed significant sexual arousal to male homosexual stimuli.[^9]

The interpretations of this study are debated — arousal could reflect anxiety rather than desire.[^9] But what the study documents unambiguously is a disproportionate reactivity: the "homophobe" doesn't look away. His body reacts. His attention is captured. This is the mechanism of obsessive fixation, not phobia.

### The triple advantage of the new term

The term *homomaniac* presents a triple advantage:

1. **Etymologically accurate**: it describes an obsession, not a fear.
2. **Clinically honest**: the psychological literature has extensively documented the compulsive and projective dimension of these behaviours.[^9][^10]
3. **Rhetorically just**: it redirects the spotlight to where the dysfunction actually lies — with the persecutor, not the persecuted. The homomaniac carries his diagnosis in his own name.

## Part Four: Generalization — Discriminatory Manias

### A pattern that repeats

What we observe for homosexuality applies to all discriminations. Everywhere, the suffix *-phobe* masks the reality of the behaviour.

The *xenomaniac* isn't afraid of foreigners — he's obsessed with their presence. He sees them everywhere, blames them for everything, builds entire political programmes on this fixation. He spends more time talking about foreigners than foreigners themselves spend thinking about him.

The *ethnomaniac* doesn't tremble before a skin colour — he scrutinizes it, categorizes it, hierarchizes it with the meticulousness of a compulsive collector.

The *transmaniac* doesn't flee transgender people — he invests disproportionate time and energy in monitoring their bodies, their identity papers, their bathrooms.

The *islamomaniac* doesn't flee Muslims — he tracks them, comments on them, monitors them, fantasizes about them, invokes them in every debate as if all civilization depended on what a woman wears on her head.

In each case, the same structure: not fearful avoidance, but obsessive fixation that devours the maniac's attention, discourse and political action.

### Who benefits from the wrong diagnosis?

Previous episodes of Roots' Garden posed the question: *cui bono* — who benefits from the crime? Let's apply it here.

Who benefits from the suffix *-phobe*?

Certainly not the victims, who find themselves linguistically associated with a negative word. Certainly not public debate, which loses precision. Certainly not psychology, which sees one of its clinical suffixes misused.

It benefits the persecutor, who can deflect: "I'm not afraid." It benefits systems of oppression, which remain unnamed: if it's an individual "phobia," it's not a social structure. And it benefits all those who prefer to pathologize individuals rather than question systems.

## Part Five: Xenomania — The Nominative Rally

### Why a unifying term?

We need to name the common trunk of all these manias. We need a word that gathers under one banner all discriminatory obsessions — a **Nominative Rally**, if you will, of behaviours that reject the other.

*(The acronym N.R. that results is merely a coincidence. Or not.)*

### Why not "heteromania"?

One could propose *heteromania*, from the Greek *heteros* (ἕτερος) — "the other," "the different." But this term poses an ambiguity problem: in common language, "hetero-" immediately evokes heterosexuality. *Heteromania* could be confused with an obsession *with* heterosexuality, which muddies the message.

### The clarity of "xenomania"

The term **xenomania** is crystal clear.

*Xenos* (ξένος) in ancient Greek designates the stranger, the one who comes from elsewhere, the one who doesn't belong to the group.[^4] It's the root of *xenophobia*, but also of *xenophilia* and the beautiful word *philoxenia* — hospitality, love of the stranger.

**Xenomania** is thus the pathological obsession with the stranger — but "stranger" in the broadest sense:

- **The national stranger**: the one from another country, another culture
- **The religious stranger**: the one who prays to another god, or the same god differently — the "restricted neighbour" of religions that limit love of neighbour to those who share the faith
- **The sexual stranger**: the one whose orientation or identity doesn't match a norm built on incomplete observation of nature
- **The ethnic stranger**: the one whose appearance differs from the local majority
- **The social stranger**: the one whose lifestyle, choices, values deviate from ambient conformism

All these "othernesses" are perceived by the xenomaniac as existential threats. Not because they actually threaten him — but because their mere existence weakens the fiction of a uniform, predictable, reassuring world.

### The revised complete structure

```
XENOMANIA (common trunk)
    Pathological obsession with the other, the different, the stranger
           │
           ├── Homomania: obsession with others' sexual orientation
           ├── Transmania: obsession with others' gender identity
           ├── Ethnomania: obsession with others' ethnic origin
           ├── Islamomania: obsession with others' religion
           ├── Hateful gynomania: obsession with controlling women
           └── etc.
           │
           ▼
    SYSTEMS OF OPPRESSION (institutionalized structures)
           ├── Heterosexism: system of heterosexual privilege
           ├── Racism: system of racial hierarchy
           ├── Patriarchy: system of male domination
           ├── Colonialism: system of exploitation of peoples
           └── etc.
```

This architecture distinguishes two levels that current vocabulary conflates:

1. **Obsession** (xenomania and its variations) — visible, compulsive behavioural level, individual but also collective
2. **System** (structures of oppression) — institutional, cultural, historical level

The xenomaniac is the foot soldier. The system is the army. Confusing the two means depriving ourselves of the ability to fight them effectively.

### What the new vocabulary reveals

| Old term | Suggests... | New term | Reveals... |
|----------|-------------|----------|------------|
| Homophobe | Fear, victim of fear | Homomaniac | Obsession, responsible for obsession |
| Xenophobe | Fear of strangers | Xenomaniac | Pathological fixation on strangers |
| Transphobe | Fear of trans people | Transmaniac | Compulsive surveillance of trans bodies |
| Islamophobe | Fear of Islam | Islamomaniac | Obsessive fantasy of the Muslim |

The suffix *-mania* does three things that *-phobia* doesn't:

1. **It responsibilizes**: you don't excuse a mania like you excuse a fear
2. **It diagnoses correctly**: obsession is the real mechanism
3. **It shifts the problem**: the dysfunction is in the observer, not the observed

## Part Six: Episode 01 in Reverse

### The link with the series

In Episode 01 of Roots' Garden, we documented the semantic drift of political parties: words that remain on bottles whose contents have changed. "Freedom," "solidarity," "social justice" — the labels remained, the meaning evaporated.

Here, we observe the opposite phenomenon: words that never had the right content. Not drift — a foundational error. The word "homophobia" didn't drift from its original meaning. It was built on an unsuitable suffix, for understandable strategic reasons whose consequences are catching up with us.

It's the same lesson, seen from the other side of the mirror: vocabulary is never innocent. When words lie — by drift or by construction — they protect the structures they claim to name.

### The xenomaniac is a coward who doesn't know it

This analysis isn't just a lexical exercise. Naming correctly is understanding correctly. And understanding correctly is being able to act justly.

Beneath the loud mania, beneath the laws and insults and violence, there may well be fear. A deep fear, often unacknowledged, sometimes unconscious: fear of a world that doesn't conform to the reassuring image we have of it. Fear that the other, by their mere existence, calls into question the solidity of our own certainties.

But this fear, the xenomaniac transforms into aggression. He doesn't flee — he attacks. And it's this transformation that must be named. Mania is the active symptom; fear is only its buried root.

The discriminatory maniac is someone whose identity is so fragile that it cannot bear the existence of otherness. His obsession with the other is only the inverted reflection of his anxiety about himself. Every law he votes against difference is an admission of insecurity. Every insult is a cry of panic. Every persecution is a desperate attempt to simplify a world whose complexity overwhelms him.

This doesn't make his acts any less serious, any less condemnable. But it changes how we view the mechanism. And in this change of perspective lies perhaps, beyond necessary resistance, a key to understanding — and therefore to transformation.

## The counter-vocabulary: naming inclusion too

If we rename pathologies, let's name virtues too. Against xenomania, there exists an antidote the Greeks knew well: **philoxenia** (φιλοξενία) — literally, love of the stranger.

Philoxenia is not naivety. It's not self-erasure before the other. It's the capacity to see in the stranger not a threat, but a possibility. A window onto a world we don't yet know. An enrichment rather than a dilution.

| Pathology | Antidote |
|-----------|----------|
| Xenomania | Philoxenia — love of the stranger, hospitality |
| Homomania | Acceptance of the diversity of loves |
| Transmania | Respect for bodily self-determination |
| Ethnomania | Recognition of equal dignity |
| Islamomania | Authentic secularism — benevolent indifference to others' beliefs |

True strength is not in uniformity — it's in the capacity to welcome difference without dissolving into it.

### The question I leave you with

Do the words we use to describe discriminations really describe them? Or do they form yet another screen between us and reality?

If vocabulary protects what it claims to fight, then the first act of resistance may be to rename. Not out of linguistic coquetry. Because you cannot heal what you cannot name.

**Xenomania**: the pathological obsession with the other. The Nominative Rally of all discriminations.

Now, we have a word.

Write to me. The garden is vast, and some roots are buried in language itself.
