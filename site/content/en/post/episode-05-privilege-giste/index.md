Dear Fore-seer of Death,

I write to you in verse
and in crossing —
for it is the only language
you have not yet
privatized.

---

## I. The one who lies in privilege

You are the **privilege-keeper**:
the one who keeps the lodging
of acquired advantages,
the one who lies
in the warm bed
of inherited certainties.

*Privilege* — from Latin *privus* (private) and *lex* (law).
The private law. The law that applies only to others.

And you, you sleep upon it.
You sleep so deeply
that you have forgotten
there was an underneath.

---

## II. The coroner who foresees

But you are also the **fore-seer of death**:
the one who foresees deaths
before they arrive,
the one who writes the death certificates
for ideas that disturb you.

*Here lies solidarity*, you write.
*Died of old age.*

*Here lies equality*, you inscribe.
*Deceased from complications.*

*Here lies hope*, you engrave.
*Cause of death: naivety.*

You bury the living
to unearth your profits.
You pronounce the endings
before the beginnings.

---

## III. But death is not a fatality

Listen to me, dear Fore-seer:

Death is not a fatality —
even for revolutionaries.

Oh, you can kill bodies.
You have done it, you do it,
you will do it again.
It's your specialty:
the clean assassination,
the administrative disappearance,
the organized oblivion.

But ideas, Sir —
ideas do not die
as men die.

They transform.
They burrow.
They wait.

---

## IV. The seed and the concrete

You have concreted over the garden.
You have poured your certainties
in gray slabs over the black earth.

And you laughed, Sir.
You said: *it's over*.
You said: *there is no alternative*.
You said: *the end of history*.

But beneath the concrete,
something is working.

It is not a ghost.
It is not nostalgia.
It is a seed
that does not need light
to know that light exists.

It pushes upward
because upward exists,
even when one cannot see it.

---

## V. The crack

And one day — not tomorrow,
perhaps not in ten years,
but one certain day —
the crack will appear.

A thin line at first.
Almost invisible.
Something that looks like
a construction error,
a manufacturing defect,
an accident.

But it will not be an accident.

It will be the root.
The root that found
the path to the air.

And then, dear Fore-seer,
you will write another report.
You will speak of *disorder*.
You will invoke *the exception*.
You will call it *a crisis*.

But you will know,
deep within you,
that it is not a crisis.

It is a birth.

---

## VI. What you cannot foresee

You are the coroner who foresees.
But here is what you cannot foresee:

You cannot foresee
the exact moment
when fatigue becomes anger.

You cannot foresee
the name of the one
who will say *no* for the first time.

You cannot foresee
the word that someone will invent
to name what had no name.

You cannot foresee
the song that will circulate
from mouth to mouth
until it becomes an anthem.

You can foresee deaths.
But you cannot foresee
rebirths.

---

## VII. The garden beneath the garden

There is a garden beneath your garden, Sir.

You do not see it
because you never look down.
Why would you?
Down is for others.

But that is where we are.
The roots.
The earthworms.
The seeds that wait.
The dead who are not dead.

We do not conspire.
We have no secret plan.
We do something
much more dangerous:

We grow.

Slowly.
Stubbornly.
Without asking permission.

---

## VIII. Epitaph for privilege

One day, Sir,
someone will write your epitaph.

Not yours personally —
you will be forgotten,
as are forgotten
all the privilege-keepers of history.

But the epitaph of privilege.
The epitaph of private law.
The epitaph of the world
where some slept above
while others dug below.

And this epitaph will perhaps say:

*Here lies privilege.*
*It believed it had killed hope.*
*But hope was not a man.*
*Hope was a root.*
*And roots do not die.*
*They transform into forest.*

---

I greet you from the underneath,

*Pépé*

*Gardener of buried words*

---

## Postscript to the reader

This text is a poem, but it is also a letter. A letter to those who write endings before beginnings, to those who decree deaths before births.

The previous episodes documented the architecture of privilege. This one celebrates what privilege cannot build: the persistence of what grows despite everything.

Death is not a fatality. Even for revolutionaries. Especially for ideas.

Roots have always known this.
