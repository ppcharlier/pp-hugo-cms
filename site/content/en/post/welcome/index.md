Welcome to Roots' Garden, a cultural project dedicated to exploring the deep roots that have shaped our societies.

## Our mission

We believe that understanding the past is essential to facing today's challenges. By studying the political, social, and industrial movements that have shaped our world, we hope to contribute to a better understanding of where we come from — and where we're going.
