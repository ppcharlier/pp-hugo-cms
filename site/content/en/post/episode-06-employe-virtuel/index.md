This week, I read that a major company had replaced 700 employees with AI. Not factory workers on an assembly line — writers, analysts, creatives. And I wondered: those 700 salaries are no longer contributing to social security. Who's going to pay?

I went digging.

## I. The Silent Great Replacement

We talk a lot about industrial jobs being replaced by robots. But the real upheaval is elsewhere: AI is now targeting cognitive work. Writing, legal analysis, medical diagnosis, graphic design, programming — professions we thought were protected by their intellectual complexity.

Studies differ on the scale: some predict 300 million jobs affected globally[^1], others are more cautious. But one thing is certain: every job replaced by AI is a salary that no longer contributes.

No pension contributions. No unemployment contributions. No health insurance contributions. AI works 24/7, never gets sick, and funds no social protection system.

**The first thread running through this article**: this rush toward AI happens without questioning its real cost — neither social nor environmental. Profits are optimised, consequences are externalised.

## II. The Gates Proposal: The Founding Idea

In 2017, Bill Gates posed a simple question in an interview with Quartz magazine: "If a human worker earning $50,000 is taxed on their income, why shouldn't the robot doing exactly the same job be taxed?"[^2]

The idea isn't to punish innovation, he clarified, but to slow down automation to give societies time to adapt, and to fund the retraining of displaced workers.

That same year, the European Parliament rejected a "robot tax" proposal. The argument? Fear of making Europe less competitive against the United States and China[^3].

But one country took the plunge: South Korea. In 2017, it reduced tax incentives for automation — an indirect form of robot taxation. A study by Kang et al. (2024) shows that this measure effectively created jobs and reduced inequality, without significantly harming competitiveness[^4].

**The question then arises**: tax the human but not the machine that replaces them and, moreover, consumes natural resources?

---

## III. Taxation Models: Advantages and Limitations

How do you tax an artificial intelligence? Several models are proposed in the economic and legal literature[^5]. Each has its merits and flaws.

### A. Taxation by tokens or queries

The idea: tax each use of AI, measured in tokens (units of processed text) or queries.

**Advantages**: Perfect technical traceability. AI providers' APIs already count tokens for billing.

**Limitations**:
- A legal token (complex contract) doesn't have the same value as a creative token (advertising slogan). Sectoral injustice.
- This model penalises efficiency: a high-performing model that responds with fewer tokens would pay less than a mediocre, verbose one.
- It favours tech giants who can negotiate economies of scale.

### B. Taxation by hours of work saved

The idea: estimate how many hours of human work AI replaces, and tax accordingly.

**Advantages**: Directly reflects job replacement. Conceptually fair.

**Limitations**:
- How to measure? How many human hours equal one hour of legal, medical, or creative AI?
- Self-declaration opens the door to fraud. Who verifies?

### C. Taxation by generated revenue

The idea: companies using AI to generate revenue pay a proportional tax.

**Advantages**: Proportional to value created. Conceptually simple.

**Limitations**:
- Attribution difficulty: what share of revenue is due to AI vs humans?
- Classic tax evasion: profit shifting, transfer pricing.

### D. Hybrid model: The "Virtual Contribution"

An emerging proposal[^6]: treat AI as a "virtual employee" with a social contribution calculated on:
- A percentage of AI usage cost
- Indexed to the median salary of the replaced sector
- Redistributed toward training, professional transition, or even universal basic income

This model has the merit of philosophical coherence: if AI does a human's work, it should contribute like a human.

## IV. The Ecological Equation: The Hidden Cost

**Here is the second thread**: the environmental cost of AI is systematically ignored in taxation debates.

The figures are staggering:
- Global electricity consumption of data centres could reach **945 TWh by 2030** — equivalent to Japan's total consumption[^7].
- AI currently represents 5 to 15% of this consumption, but could reach **35 to 50% by 2030**[^8].
- AI's carbon footprint in 2025 is estimated between **32.6 and 79.7 million tonnes of CO2**[^9].
- According to Goldman Sachs, **60% of additional electricity** needed for data centres will come from fossil fuels[^10].
- Generating a single AI image consumes as much energy as a **full smartphone charge**[^11].

These figures raise a fundamental question: can this ecological footprint be justified for productivity gains whose benefits are captured by a few companies?

**An honest AI tax should include an environmental component**: a bonus-malus system based on the energy efficiency of the model used, the data centre's electricity mix, and carbon footprint transparency.

## V. The Carbon Credit Scam

AI giants often claim to be "carbon neutral" through the purchase of carbon credits. But what are these credits worth?

In November 2024, "Operation Greenwashing" in Brazil indicted 31 people for 180 million reais in fraud involving fictitious carbon credits[^12].

More seriously: a 2023 study estimates that **only 12% of carbon credits correspond to actual emission reductions**[^13]. The rest? Paper, forests that would have been preserved anyway, abandoned projects.

AI giants cannot "offset" their footprint with dubious offsets. It's creative accounting, not ecology.

**The question then becomes**: can an AI tax be more honest than carbon credits? Can it fund real transitions rather than virtual certificates?

---

## VI. Who Pays? Who Collects?

Implementing an AI tax poses formidable practical questions.

**Who pays?**
- The end user (the company using ChatGPT to replace its writers)?
- The AI provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google)?
- The employer saving on salaries?

**Who collects?**
- The state where the company is based?
- The state where the AI is "employed"?
- A jurisdiction where the data centre is located?

An AI agent can work simultaneously for companies in 50 countries, from servers located in a 51st. The very notion of "workplace" collapses.

Precedents are not encouraging. The GAFA tax showed the difficulty of international tax coordination. The EU AI Act of 2024 regulates AI ethics, but not its taxation[^14].

## VII. The Humanist Argument: Why Preserve Jobs

Beyond economics, there's a civilisational question.

Work is not just an exchange of time for money. It's a social bond, a source of dignity, a structure of meaning. Studies on long-term unemployment show its ravages on mental health, well beyond income loss.

AI can free up time — but for whom? For what? If AI works and profits go to a few shareholders, what does society gain?

The danger of automation at all costs: confusing **efficiency** with **human progress**. A society where AI produces everything but where humans no longer have a role is not progress — it's a dystopia.

---

## The question I leave you with

Do we want a society where AI works so that humans can consume? Or a society where AI assists humans so they can create, heal, teach, invent?

The answer to this question will determine whether AI taxation is a simple accounting measure or a civilisational choice.

Write to me. The garden is vast, and these roots run deep.
