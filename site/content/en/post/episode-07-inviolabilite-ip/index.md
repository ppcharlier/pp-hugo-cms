Intellectual property (IP) is not merely a legal technique. It is a political trade-off between two rights that have coexisted from the very beginning: the right to participate in cultural life and to benefit from scientific progress, and the right of authors to the protection of their moral and material interests.[^1][^2]

At the international level, this trade-off is reflected in trade agreements (TRIPS) that set protection standards, but also in flexibility clauses for public health, reaffirmed in the Doha Declaration.[^3][^4]

This text does not seek a definitive answer. It describes frameworks, cases and tensions. And it recalls that the "inviolability" of IP is never absolute: it is regulated, limited, interpreted.

## I. Belgium: automatic protection, anchored in the CEL

In Belgium, copyright applies automatically as soon as an original work is given form: no formalities are required, and a mere idea is not protected.[^5]

On the legislative front, copyright and neighbouring rights are integrated into Book XI of the Code of Economic Law (CEL), which groups intellectual property provisions together.[^6]

---

## II. France: a moral right attached to the person

Under French law, article L121-1 of the Intellectual Property Code enshrines a moral right attached to the author's person: it is perpetual, inalienable and imprescriptible.[^7]

This specificity serves as a reminder that, in certain systems, the work never fully separates from its author, even when economic rights are assigned.

---

## III. Europe: harmonised duration, accessibility exceptions

At the European level, the term of protection is harmonised: Directive 2006/116 sets the general rule of the author's life plus 70 years.[^8]

But the European Union also provides for access exceptions. Directive 2017/1564 (implementing the Marrakesh Treaty) creates an exception to copyright to allow the production and exchange of accessible formats for the benefit of persons who are print-disabled.[^9]

The European balance does not abolish IP: it frames it.

## IV. An individual case: J.K. Rowling and the work/author dissociation

J.K. Rowling worked for Amnesty International before becoming one of the most widely read authors in the world.[^11] In 2020, she published a lengthy text on her website, explaining her positions on sex and gender issues and her concerns regarding certain legal and social developments.[^10]

These statements sparked international controversy and public reactions, including from actors associated with the Harry Potter universe and from a section of the public.[^12]

Here, the question is not to settle the debate, but to observe the dissociation that the law permits: the work continues to be exploited, and the author continues to receive revenues, even when their public image is contested.

## V. Case law and counter-examples (Americas, Africa, Asia)

### Americas — United States: "Son of Sam" laws

In New York, a so-called "Son of Sam" law aimed to seize revenues from books or works describing crimes. In 1991, the US Supreme Court ruled this law unconstitutional under the First Amendment (Simon & Schuster v. Crime Victims Board).[^13]

The logic of IP (freedom of expression and author revenues) thus prevailed over the idea of automatically blocking crime-related revenues.

### Americas — Brazil: compulsory licence on efavirenz

In 2007, Brazil issued a compulsory licence on efavirenz, a key antiretroviral, after unsuccessful negotiations. The operation enabled the importation of generics at reduced prices, within the TRIPS flexibility framework.[^14]

Here, public health temporarily prevailed over patent exclusivity.

### Africa — South Africa: challenge then withdrawal

South Africa adopted a law in 1997 aimed at facilitating access to affordable medicines, notably through generic substitution and other mechanisms.[^15]

Pharmaceutical companies challenged this law. The proceedings were withdrawn in 2001 after strong international mobilisation, leaving the legal framework in place.[^16]

### Asia — India: Novartis v. Union of India

In 2013, the Indian Supreme Court upheld the rejection of the patent sought by Novartis on Glivec, relying on Section 3(d) of Indian law, which aims to prevent the "evergreening" of patents without significant therapeutic improvement.[^17]

The ruling illustrates a state's determination to preserve access to generics within a strict legal framework.

---

## VI. Why IP remains legitimate

The foundational human rights texts explicitly recognise the protection of authors' moral and material interests.[^1][^2]

The Doha Declaration also recalls that the protection of intellectual property is important for the development of new medicines, while affirming the right of states to protect public health.[^4]

In other words: IP is not a dogma, but it remains an economic and cultural pillar. The debate is not about its abolition, but about its limits.

---

## Conclusion: a structuring tension, not a single solution

The inviolability of IP is a legal construction that varies by country, sector and era. It coexists with exceptions (accessibility, compulsory licences) and with attempts to limit revenues in cases of crime ("Son of Sam" laws).[^9][^13][^14]

Scandals, injustices and health crises do not make this framework disappear: they put it to the test. And it is in this test — more than in a simple answer — that the contemporary question of justice is at stake.
