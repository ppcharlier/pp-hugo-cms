## Recap of the previous episode

In episodes 01 and 02, we established that certain taboos do not serve collective protection but rather particular interests: organized crime, the financial system, conservative movements, geopolitical powers. We documented the "feedback loop":

```
Taboo → Black market → Mafia profits → Political corruption → Maintenance of the taboo...
```

This episode explores a missing link in this analysis: **the role of migrant populations and their descendants as visible "foot soldiers" of a system from which they are never the true beneficiaries**.

## Part One: The Ethnic Pyramid of Trafficking

### The documented stratification

A sociological study published in the *European Journal of Sociology* on Marseille reveals a precise hierarchy within drug networks. In Félix-Pyat, the network "was originally controlled by, and exclusively involved, Algerians. This started to change around 2010, when young non-Algerian residents began to be recruited as *guetteurs* (lookouts) and low-level *rabatteurs* (street dealers). According to several interviewees, most of the latter were of Comorian origin, and were mistreated and exploited by the Algerians, who kept for themselves the higher-level jobs: *charbonneurs* (drug handlers), *gérants de point de vente* (sale point managers), or *gérants de quartier* (area managers)."[^20]

The hierarchy is also generational: "More than actual age group, these categories represented an occupational hierarchy within the drug trade, with the *petits* generally acting as lookouts and street dealers, and the *grands* as drug handlers and sale point managers."[^20]

### The "foot soldiers" of the market

The *Organized Crime Index* confirms this structure at the national level: "The market is structured in hierarchical criminal networks, with low-level 'petites mains' managing distribution."[^21]

These "foot soldiers" are overwhelmingly recruited from marginalized populations. A report analyzing the evolution of organized crime in France notes that "in the 2000s, minorities (notably French of North African origin: Algerians, Tunisians and Moroccans) living in disadvantaged suburbs participate in the construction of new criminal networks, not as hierarchical and centralized as gangs, but involved in different types of trafficking, particularly drug trafficking."[^22]

### The double exploitation

The exploitation is twofold:

1. **Economic**: maximum risk (prison, violence), minimum pay, instant replaceability
2. **Political**: their visibility on the street fuels racist stereotypes that justify their initial marginalization

As an analysis published in the *Daily Sabah* notes: "The roots of the current crisis go back decades of failed social engineering, visibly reflected in the country's HLM public housing system. Designed to provide affordable housing, these estates gradually evolved into segregated zones where communities of immigrant origin were concentrated, isolated and ultimately abandoned by the state. This spatial segregation produced more than poor living conditions; it entrenched a parallel society."[^23]

## Part Two: The Invisible Upward Flow

### Who are the real bosses?

The cruel irony of the system: **the true beneficiaries never look like the faces in the arrest reports**.

French criminologist Xavier Raufer observes that "white-collar criminality — financial fraud, embezzlement — is almost entirely committed by native-born French citizens."[^24]

An Italian study on mafia money laundering confirms this pattern: laundering operations "show an important role of white-collar crimes, such as fraud (45.4%), tax offences (28.8%), fictitious registration of assets (20.8%) and corruption (10.2%)."[^25]

### Money flows up, arrests flow down

The system works like an inverted funnel:

```
Street level: visible dealers (migrants, minorities)
           ↓ money flows up
Intermediate level: local logistics operators
           ↓ money flows up
Regional level: importers, wholesalers
           ↓ money flows up
Upper level: launderers, financiers, "respectable" figures
```

Milan anti-mafia prosecutor Alessandra Dolci sums it up: "In Italy, there is no social stigma for those who issue false invoices or defraud the tax authorities. Social views on economic crimes are very different from those on drug trafficking."[^26]

The risk/reward calculus is telling: "If you are caught trying to sell just 50 grams of cocaine, you risk up to 20 years in prison. But if you issue false invoices to obtain 500 million euros in fraudulent tax credits, you face only 18 months to 6 years in prison. There is no comparison when it comes to assessing the risk/reward ratio."[^26]

### "Respectable" money laundering

The *Organized Crime Index* for Italy documents the role of established professionals: "The involvement of private sector actors in organized crime continues to facilitate illicit financial flows and economic crimes. Professionals such as lawyers, accountants and consultants act as intermediaries for mafia organizations, assisting in financial fraud, money laundering and corporate crimes."[^27]

## Part Three: The Racial Reinforcement Loop

### The documented mechanism

*Human Rights Watch* analyzed racial disparities in drug-related arrests in the United States. The findings are damning:

"In poor black neighborhoods, drug transactions are more likely to be conducted in the streets, in public, and between strangers, whereas in white neighborhoods — from working class to upper class — drugs are more likely to be sold indoors, in bars, clubs and private homes."[^28]

The consequence: "Law enforcement concentrates its resources in low-income, predominantly minority urban areas, [so] whites guilty of drug offenses have been disproportionately exempted."[^28]

The statistics are stark: "Blacks are arrested for drug offenses at more than three times the rate of whites and are sent to prison on drug convictions at ten times the rate of whites. These disparities cannot be explained by racial differences in drug crime patterns."[^29]

### The self-feeding stereotype

Researcher William Stuntz describes the mechanism: "Racial profiling is almost inevitable. Race becomes one of the easily observable visual cues to help identify drug suspects, along with age, gender, and location. There is a certain rationality to it — if you are in poor black neighborhoods, drug dealers are more likely to be black."[^30]

This "rationality" is circular: more minorities are arrested because they are surveilled more, which produces statistics that "justify" surveilling them even more.

### The self-fulfilling political prophecy

The loop closes politically. The *Mixed Migration Centre* documents how "populist leaders frequently attribute major societal problems — such as unemployment, housing shortages, violence, criminality, insecurity, drug trafficking and human trafficking — to lax migration policies. This narrative is reinforced by racist, xenophobic and degrading rhetoric."[^31]

In France, a report notes, "right-wing parties, particularly the Rassemblement National, blame immigration for problems such as unemployment, delinquency and crime, emphasizing the financial burden of social welfare payments to foreigners and their families."[^32]

## Part Four: The Complete Closed Circuit

### The updated loop

We can now complete the diagram from episode 01:

```
DRUG TABOO
      ↓
Creation of the black market
      ↓
Recruitment from marginalized populations
(migrants, descendants, abandoned neighborhoods)
      ↓
VISIBILITY of "foot soldiers" in street trafficking
      ↓
Disproportionate arrests
      ↓
"Ethnic" crime statistics
      ↓
CONFIRMATION of racist stereotypes
      ↓
Instrumentalization by the far right
("crime = immigration")
      ↓
Reinforced exclusion/repression policies
      ↓
INCREASED MARGINALIZATION of the same populations
      ↓
Enlarged recruitment pool for trafficking
      ↓
Back to the beginning...
```

Meanwhile, profits **flow upward** to "respectable" importers, professional launderers, compliant banks, real estate investments, the infiltrated legal economy — who are almost **never troubled** and remain **invisible**.

### The real winners of the loop

1. **"Native" organized crime**: uses a workforce at maximum risk and minimum cost, while remaining invisible

2. **The far right**: reaps electoral dividends from the fear and statistics it helps create through its exclusion policies

3. **The financial system**: launders hundreds of billions through "respectable" professionals

4. **Geopolitical powers**: Russia simultaneously funds anti-immigration and anti-LGBTQ+ movements that weaken Western social cohesion[^33]

### The systemic losers

1. **Migrants and their descendants**: doubly victimized — economically exploited as "foot soldiers," then politically stigmatized

2. **Drug users**: criminalized rather than treated

3. **Working-class neighborhoods**: abandoned by the state then designated as a security problem

4. **Society as a whole**: divided, impoverished by the underground economy, governed by fear

## Part Five: The Hypothesis of Intentional Convergence

### A taboo question: what if this were no accident?

An uncomfortable question emerges: this configuration serves too many interests too well to be purely accidental.

Do mafias have an interest in migrants being marginalized? **Yes** — it expands the recruitment pool.

Do mafias have an interest in the far right thriving? **Yes** — it guarantees the maintenance of prohibition.

Does the far right have an interest in trafficking persisting in disadvantaged neighborhoods? **Yes** — it validates its rhetoric.

Does the financial system have an interest in trafficking remaining illegal? **Yes** — money laundering is more profitable than legal finance.

### The documented connections

In previous episodes, we recalled the links between Forza Italia and Cosa Nostra in Italy, or between the 'Ndrangheta and the Australian Liberal Party.

In France, sociologist Marie Jauffret-Roustide notes that "poor people who think they can make quick money by being mules" are "increasingly exploited by traffickers."[^34]

The OFSAT report establishes that drug trafficking in France "is no longer driven by South American cartels. Instead, cocaine and cannabis now primarily come from North Africa, with a smaller share coming from sub-Saharan Africa. What is even more striking is the level of cooperation between criminal networks. Rather than competing, these groups are increasingly investing in each other's operations."[^23]

## Conclusion: Who manufactures the scapegoats?

The "ethnic screen" of drug trafficking functions as a system of **collective denial**:

- Exclusion policies create the conditions for recruitment
- Trafficking recruits from marginalized populations
- The police arrest the visible, not the profiteers
- The media show the faces of the "foot soldiers"
- The far right capitalizes on these images
- Exclusion policies are reinforced

**The taboo does not fight trafficking — it makes it invisible for its true beneficiaries.**

The final question is not "How do we fight trafficking?" but "Who has an interest in us never asking this question?"

The street-corner dealer is a **screen**. Behind him, in the shadows, Swiss bank accounts fill up, far-right movements advance, and the real network heads sleep soundly.

The taboo protects the powerful by sacrificing the vulnerable.
