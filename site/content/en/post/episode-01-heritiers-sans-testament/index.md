This week, I watched a political debate. Three parties clashed, each certain of carrying THE authentic tradition. And I wondered: what would their founders say if they saw this?

I went digging.

## The liberals: from emancipation to... something else

On June 14, 1846, the Liberal Party was born at Brussels City Hall. It was the first political party in Belgian history. Its founders? Lawyers, journalists, romantic young people who saw themselves as heirs to the great emancipatory movement of the late 18th century.

Their fight? The independence of civil power from the clergy. The party was seen as a progressive formation — as the left of its era.

You read that right: **the left**. The liberals of 1846 defended the small against the powerful.

## The socialists: from the streets to the palace

On April 5, 1885, the Belgian Workers' Party was founded by a hundred delegates from trade unions, mutual aid societies, and cooperatives. Not professional politicians: workers, craftsmen, people who pooled resources to survive together.

The party of the oppressed now manages the system. Is that betrayal or a necessary evolution?

## The Christian democrats: from Rerum Novarum to managers

In 1891, the encyclical *Rerum Novarum* inspired believing militants to found Christian democracy, convinced of the urgency of creating legislation in favor of social justice.

The original idea? The Gospel commands social justice. The poor are not a fatality but a scandal.

## The universal pattern

1. **A birth in urgency** — Every movement is born from real suffering.
2. **The conquest of power** — The movement grows and wins.
3. **Institutionalization** — To endure, compromises are needed.
4. **Management replaces vision** — One defends achievements more than conquering new horizons.
5. **The words remain, the meaning evaporates** — "Freedom," "solidarity," "social justice": the labels remain on bottles whose contents have changed.
