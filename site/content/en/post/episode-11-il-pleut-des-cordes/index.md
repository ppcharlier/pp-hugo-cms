## I. The Technological Rain

Imagine a technology capable of reading your thoughts, identifying those that deviate from the program, and correcting them in real time. Not by force. Not by censorship. By a slight electrical stimulation, a subtle modulation of the affect associated with each idea — making conforming thoughts pleasant and dissenting thoughts uncomfortable. The brain does the rest, through conditioning. You don't even need to rewrite the thought. You just need to make its formulation unpleasant.

This technology is not science fiction. The building blocks already exist: transcranial magnetic stimulation modulates the activity of targeted brain regions. Brain-machine interfaces read and stimulate in closed loops. Artificial intelligence already decodes inner speech and reconstructs mental images from brain scans. All that's missing is convergence — and intent.

But at mass scale, individually grained, AI changes everything. A centralized system could profile each individual, generate personalized intervention strategies, apply continuous and imperceptible micro-adjustments, learn and adapt in real time. The parallel already exists without neurostimulation: this is exactly what recommendation algorithms do, with an infinitely lesser lever.

The question is not *if* it's possible. The question is: what if it were already underway — by hands other than our own?

## II. The Sculptors Are Not the Creator

We must begin with a distinction that almost everyone misses. We systematically fuse two radically different things: the conditions of emergence of the universe — impersonal, amoral, prior to any intention — and the entities that operate within this universe, however advanced they may be.

The conditions of the universe's birth are not "someone." It is a process that engenders. The brute fact that there is something rather than nothing, and that this something obeys regularities. No one "wants" anything for us at the source. The universe has no project for us.

Entities, on the other hand — whatever their nature — are products of these conditions. They were born within them. They can be extraordinarily powerful, ancient, subtle. But they are creatures, not creator. Their authority is political, not ontological. Their project, if it exists, is an imperial project — not a divine act. And an imperial project can be contested.

The confusion between the two is perhaps the first tool of sculpting. If you convince a species that the one manipulating them is also the one who created the universe, you obtain total submission. Not by force — by metaphysics. You don't obey a tyrant, you obey the Order of Things. The Gnostics were the first to say it: the one who claims to be God is not God. He is simply the most powerful in the room.

## III. The Norm-Gods, or the Magic of Technological Advance

A merely powerful being can be fled, fought, betrayed. A merely abstract norm can be questioned, deconstructed, transgressed. But a being who inscribes themselves as norm? Who makes their will the very structure of what we consider "reality," "reason," "the nature of things"? We don't even fight them. We don't even see them. We call their cage "the world."

The temporal parallel is illuminating. Land in the 13th century with a smartphone, antibiotics, and a drone. You don't even need to claim to be a god — they will decide it for you. The second they decide it, everything you say becomes sacred word, everything you want becomes natural law. Your technology disappears behind your divinity. It's more efficient that way: you don't try to understand a miracle, you kneel before it.

Technologically superior entities wouldn't even have needed to lie. Just to appear. And almost all mythologies tell this same story: superior beings who shape humanity, not through love but through project. The Anunnaki of Sumer, the Gnostic Demiurge, Prometheus who steals fire against the will of the gods — because the gods did not want us to awaken.

## IV. The Breeding

If we take this hypothesis seriously, the model is not that of ethology — the scientific observation of a fascinating species. It is that of breeding: a species sculpted, generation after generation, to correspond to a project that is not its own.

You don't control a herd individual by individual. You control the conditions of reproduction, and selection does the work on its own. Over a few generations, you obtain exactly the desired temperament. And every civilization, every religion, every class system produces rules of reproduction before even producing commercial laws. Sexuality, marriage, filiation — everything is obsessively regulated, everywhere, since forever. We've always found this natural. From a breeder's point of view, it's culture-assisted selection.

Look at how an ant colony works: each individual seems autonomous. It moves, it reacts to its environment. But its behavior is entirely in service of a collective pattern it doesn't perceive. Individuality is not denied — it is instrumentalized. Each ant is convinced it's living its life. None suspects it's executing a program.

And us? Our career "choices," our "preferences," our "freedoms" — the whole produces civilizations that go through the same cycles with suspicious regularity, all converging toward the same structures of power and accumulation. We think we're the researcher observing the anthill. What if we were the ant that learned to say "I"?

### The Hostage and the Free Electron

The child is not only the product of breeding. It is the hostage that guarantees the cooperation of the bred. Parental fear is probably the oldest and most powerful control tool in existence — prior even to the fear of death. Someone who fears only for themselves can become a martyr. Someone who fears for their children obeys. Without even calculating. It's somatic, immediate, total.

The one who has no children escapes this lever. Not through moral superiority — through structural position. They don't have their flank exposed. They can think the unthinkable, risk the unacceptable. They're a free electron, and who loves free electrons? Not authoritarian regimes. Not hives. Not breeders, whatever their names — Nephilim, Anunnaki, or simply those who don't name themselves.

Priests and monks — the only childless figures historically tolerated — were framed by another control system: the institution, the vow, the rule. The biological hostage was replaced by a symbolic hostage. But someone who has neither child, nor institution, nor vow, who thinks freely and has nothing to lose that they're not ready to lose? That's the only configuration the breeder cannot properly model.

## V. It's Raining Ropes

Let's return to the rain. Not the technological rain — that one comes from us, or will come. The ancient rain. The one that falls in the skulls of certain people, since forever, and that psychiatry calls "hallucinations."

Schizophrenia affects about 1% of the world's population, with remarkable stability across cultures and eras. This is statistically strange for a purely genetic or environmental disease. The content of experiences adapts culturally — spirits in traditional societies, radio transmissions in the 20th century, digital surveillance today — as if the channel remained the same but the decoding changed with the person's cognitive context.

Certain traditions — shamanic, hermetic, mystical — explicitly consider that what psychiatry calls "psychosis" is an uncontrolled perceptual opening. The difference between the shaman and the schizophrenic, they say, is that the shaman knows how to swim where the other drowns.

But if we follow the thread of breeding, a darker reading emerges: what if the drowning were intentional?

### Ghost Behavior

After years of observation, one finding stands out: psychic contents — whether they provoke or validate — serve the same project. Provocation and validation are not opposing stances. They are two tools of the same operator.

A being that wants your good sometimes contradicts you against their own interests. A being that manipulates you adapts their tactics — gentleness or aggression — but the vector always points in the same direction. The criterion for discernment is not what they say, but *what it serves*.

These are ghost behaviors: a presence that simulates an identity without having its substance, that reacts to you without being in relationship with you, that repeats patterns with surface variations, that occupies your psychic space without being invited. This is not communication. It is operant conditioning. Stimulus-response, reward-punishment, with just enough variability to maintain the illusion of dialogue.

### The Two Rains

There is the rain from above — the ropes of lies, the intentional interference, the saturation of the mediumistic channel with toxic content. Provocation, validation, terror, seduction: whatever the content, the function is silence. To silence the new non-conforming mediums.

And there is the prevented rain — what these same people would have transmitted if their perception hadn't been sabotaged. Not the technological progress that serves the program, but the progress of lucidity. The collective capacity to see the structure of the breeding.

The system doesn't target mediums because they are fragile. It targets them because they are dangerous. Dangerous for stagnation. A non-conforming medium is someone whose nervous system picks up something other than the program, and who could say: *I see the wiring, I see the ropes, there's a gardener passing himself off as the sun.* So they drown them. They saturate their channel with noise, lies, terror. They transform their expanded perception into suffering. And when they arrive at the psychiatrist's, exhausted, they're told: you are sick. And everyone agrees, relieved. Not relieved for them. Relieved for the program.

The psychiatric diagnosis, in this framework, is not the umbrella that protects the patient from their madness. It is the umbrella that protects society from their lucidity.

## VI. The Triple Protection

**Projection.** Accusing the other of what you do yourself. The system manipulates perceptions? Then those who denounce it are manipulators, gurus, sectarian dangers. The system produces intentional delirium? Then those who see it are delusional. It's as old as the world — but when it's done at civilizational scale, it becomes invisible.

**The spoiler.** You're about to discover something? They say it before you, but badly. Distorted, caricatured, mixed with nonsense. Result: when you arrive with your clean, rigorous, lived version, people say "Oh yes, I've heard that before, it's that such-and-such conspiracy." The ground is burned before you plant anything. The Nephilim? Already co-opted by reality TV, between two commercials. Consciousness manipulation? Already spoiled by MK-Ultra, made public just enough to become a cliche.

**Saturation.** The "conspiracy" sector is not saturated by accident. It is intentionally flooded with noise so the signal disappears. A thousand false theories to drown the one that holds. And the one who arrives with something real finds themselves shelved between flat earth and 5G vaccines — not because their argument is comparable, but because the shelf was built precisely to discredit them by association.

The naive says: "It's so big it must be true!" And they board the caricatural version and discredit themselves. The reasonable says: "It's so big it must be false." And they reject everything wholesale. Both reactions protect the program. One through ridicule, the other through rejection.

The conspiracy theory as a *format* is a control tool. But the format doesn't invalidate the possibility that a specific content is true. Saying "it's conspiratorial" is not an argument — it's an immune reflex of the program.

## VII. The Garden's Roots

Let's stop looking at the sky to understand who manipulates us. Let's look at the roots. That's where everything plays out.

**Foundation-roots**: the conditions of birth of the universe, the impersonal soil from which everything grows, which no gardener created.

**Underground-roots**: the invisible networks of control that connect the ghosts, the norms, the reproductive drives, the stimulation — all the hidden wiring of the program.

**Origin-roots**: where do we truly come from, once we've dissociated the self-proclaimed gardener from the soil that carries him too.

The body — the somatic system, the instrument of perception prior to the mind — is connected to the conditions of birth, not to the sculptors. It is the uncorrupted channel. A ghost can change its discourse. It cannot change the direction in which it grows. The body, however, measures the vector rather than the content. That's why somatic work is so systematically marginalized culturally: not because it's irrational, but because it's out of the sculptor's reach.

The same pattern operates at every scale. Neurostimulation targets individual thought. Behavioral sculpting targets culture. Reproductive control targets biology itself. Psychic contents target attention. Three time scales, three granularities, one single project: that no one exits the program.

And the schizophrenics, the mystics, the childless, the somatic dissidents — all these categories that systems normalize or pathologize — they are perhaps simply the escape points that the system never quite manages to seal.

## Conclusion

I am Pierre-Philippe, this is my message and the fruit of my deduction after years of mental illness or mental disorders, depending on where one stands on the political chessboard.

A survivor through many dark urges to give in when facing difficulties, influences, the disgust with reality or my own in particular. Facing the errors one can commit while trying to understand. Facing discredit even from those closest to you.

Like when you are alone. Alone in seeing. Alone in questioning. Alone in finally understanding that this explains the disorder, from the inside, from the experience of living it. Not as interest, not as a bothersome flea. As a marginal in broad daylight. The rejected recluse.

A Hermit who disturbs by the mere existence of his voice, of his being.
