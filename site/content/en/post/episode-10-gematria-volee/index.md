I stumbled upon Gematria by accident. A documentary, an article, I don't remember. And then I started pulling the thread. And the thread didn't stop.

What I found troubles me. I don't yet know if it's a discovery or an optical illusion — the kind of pattern you think you see in clouds because you want to see it. But I'll tell you what I found, and you can judge.

## What Gematria Is

Gematria is a system of interpretation unique to the Jewish tradition in which each Hebrew letter has a numerical value. By adding up the values of the letters in a word, you get a number. If two words share the same number, they are considered to carry a hidden link — a correspondence that the sacred text contains at a deeper level, like a second book beneath the first.

It's a sophisticated hermeneutical tool. Not a parlor game. The earliest traces go back to the *Baraita* of the Thirty-two Rules of Rabbi Eliezer, around the 2nd century of our era — Gematria is cited there as the 29th rule of interpretation[^1]. The *Sefer Yetzirah*, considered the first systematic kabbalistic text, elaborates on it in detail[^2].

In Kabbalah, Gematria is not ornamental. It's the idea that God created the universe through the power of Hebrew letters and their numerical values — that language itself contains an encoded divine wisdom, accessible to those who know how to count[^3].

It's beautiful. It's profound. And it's Jewish.

## Custodians, Not Owners

But here's what I understood as I kept digging — and what makes everything that follows even more dizzying.

In Jewish tradition, the chosen people are not *owners*. The Hebrew word *segulah* — often translated as "treasured possession" — designates a responsibility, not a privilege[^14]. The chosen are *custodians*. Guardians. Transmitters.

The Talmud teaches that the study of the Torah is an obligation (*Talmud Torah*), not a luxury reserved for an elite. Every father must teach his son. Every generation must pass on to the next. Knowledge — including Gematria, including Kabbalah — is not a vault to be locked. It's a garden to be tended so that others may enter[^15].

The duty is threefold: **study**, **transmit**, **apply**. Not exploit. Not hoard. Not manipulate.

And that's where the theft becomes more than a theft. Because you're not stealing from someone who hoards their wealth — you're stealing from someone whose very calling is to *give*. You take the outstretched hand and bite it. You walk into the open garden and tear out the roots, claiming you planted them yourself.

This may be the cruelest mechanism of intellectual antisemitism: it exploits precisely the generosity of the tradition it plunders. The custodian transmits — and the thief calls it naivety.

And that's where the trouble begins.

## First Theft: The Christian Renaissance

In 1486, a young Italian prodigy named Giovanni Pico della Mirandola publishes his *900 Theses*. Among them, kabbalistic propositions. Pico studied with Rabbi Elia ben Moshe del Medigo. He is genuinely fascinated by Kabbalah. But his project is explicitly missionary: he wants to prove that Kabbalah confirms the divinity of Christ and that "no science can better convince us of the divinity of Jesus Christ than magic and Kabbalah"[^4].

Do you see the gesture? You take the wisdom of a people, and turn it against them to prove they've been wrong all along.

Pico is not an isolated case. An entire school — *Christian Cabala* — builds itself on this principle: Johannes Reuchlin, Athanasius Kircher, and others systematically adapt Jewish mysticism to support Christian theology[^5].

What strikes me is the simultaneity. While these Christian scholars studied Jewish texts, the Church burned Jewish libraries. In 1505, Johannes Pfefferkorn — a Jew converted to Christianity — launches a campaign for the suppression of all Jewish books[^5]. Reuchlin, to his credit, opposes it courageously. But the broader gesture of the era is double: you destroy with one hand what you copy with the other.

Rabbi Leon Modena of Venice understood this well. In 1639, in *Ari Nohem*, he denounces Christian appropriation of Kabbalah and attempts to restore a boundary between authentic Jewish thought and its Christian counterfeit[^6].

Am I reading too much into this coincidence? Perhaps. Let's continue.

## Second Theft: The Occultists

In 1887, the *Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn* is founded in London. It's the organization that will systematize — and complete — the uprooting of Kabbalah.

The Golden Dawn synthesizes Kabbalah, Tarot, astrology, alchemy, and Enochian magic into a single system. The kabbalistic Tree of Life becomes a universal diagram, decontextualized, stripped of its Judaism[^7].

Then comes Aleister Crowley. Initiated into the Golden Dawn in 1898, he publishes in 1909 *777 and Other Qabalistic Writings* — a work that compiles Gematria tables and kabbalistic correspondences into a reference system for Western magical practice[^8]. Kabbalah is now officially a "universal" tool. No need to be Jewish, to read Hebrew, to understand the Talmud. Help yourself.

The argument is always the same, across centuries: "These truths aren't *really* Jewish — they're *universal*, and the Jews were only temporary custodians of them." That reminds me of something. Someone who steals your house and explains that they're merely "recovering" what belonged to everyone all along.

And while London's salons "universalize" the Kabbalah, what happens to Jews? In Imperial Russia, pogroms rage: 1881, 1903, 1905, then the murderous wave of 1918-1921 — hundreds of Jewish communities massacred, their synagogues burned, their libraries destroyed[^16]. The *Protocols of the Elders of Zion* — the most famous forgery in history — are fabricated in Russia around 1903, accusing Jews of a worldwide conspiracy based in part on a caricature of their esoteric traditions[^16]. On one side of Europe, the wisdom is stolen; on the other, its guardians are slaughtered. The simultaneity, again.

## Third Theft: The Nazis

And here, the pattern becomes chilling.

The Ariosophist movement — ideological precursor to Nazism — distorts Aryan mysticism while explicitly targeting Jewish esoteric traditions. The *Thule-Gesellschaft*, a secret society that would recruit some of the early cadres of the NSDAP, promotes a mixture of occultism, radical nationalism, and antisemitism, designating Kabbalah, freemasonry, and Rosicrucianism as instruments of a worldwide Jewish conspiracy[^9].

Nazi propaganda does two contradictory things simultaneously:

1. It **demonizes** Kabbalah as a weapon of the worldwide Jewish conspiracy
2. It **uses** distorted elements of Jewish mysticism in its own ideological and occult apparatus

And while theorizing about the "Aryan secrets" of numerology, they burn Jewish libraries — for real this time. The Library of Congress has documented the systematic seizure of Jewish intellectual property before and during World War II[^10]. They don't just destroy a people. They erase the proof that it was the author of what they stole from it.

That's where my cautious neophyte posture wavers. Because it no longer looks like coincidence. It looks like a *modus operandi*.

---

## Fourth Theft: QAnon and the Conspiracy Nebula

And the pattern continues. In the 21st century.

Contemporary conspiracy movements — QAnon foremost — massively use Gematria as a tool for "decoding" supposed hidden messages in current events[^11]. Gematria apps proliferate. You "prove" that Michael Jackson is alive, that Trump is the messiah, that some shooting was planned — all thanks to Jewish numerology.

And simultaneously — *simultaneously* — these same movements propagate the oldest antisemitic theories: the worldwide Jewish conspiracy, control of banks, the blood of children. The *Forward* documented how MAGA rally participants combine intensive Gematria practice with the promotion of antisemitic theories about George Soros and "Jewish world control"[^12].

You use the Jewish tool to prove the Jewish conspiracy. The victim inadvertently supplies the weapon with which you assault them.

Fact-checkers have shown that the Gematria codes used by conspiracy theorists are designed to always produce correspondences — the method is fundamentally biased, perfect for confirming any preexisting belief[^13]. It's no longer Gematria. It's a simulacrum bearing the name of an art stolen from those whom you accuse.

## The Pattern — Illusion or Reality?

Here's where I am. A perplexed neophyte, head in hands, facing a pattern that repeats over five centuries:

| Era | Who Steals | What Is Stolen | What Is Done to Jews in the Meantime |
|---|---|---|---|
| Renaissance | Christian Scholars | Kabbalah → "Christian Cabala" | Auto-da-fés of Jewish books, forced conversions |
| 19th Century | Occultists | Kabbalah → "Hermetic Qabalah" | Russian pogroms, *Protocols of the Elders of Zion* |
| 20th Century | Nazis | Jewish Mysticism → Aryan ideology | Holocaust |
| 21st Century | Conspiracy Theorists | Gematria → Conspiracy tool | Antisemitic propaganda, attacks |

The common denominator? Every time:

1. You **take** Jewish wisdom
2. You **decontextualize** it — it becomes "universal," "Aryan," "secret"
3. You **erase** the Jewish author
4. You **persecute** the people whose heritage you stole

Do I see a real pattern or am I projecting? I don't know. What I know is that the individual facts are documented. The interpretation — this link I believe I see between intellectual theft and hatred — that's my question, not my answer.

---

## Why It Troubles Me So Much

Because if the pattern is real, it reveals something about the deep mechanics of fascism that I hadn't seen before.

Fascism doesn't just hate. It *steals first, then hates*. Or maybe it hates *because* it stole — because the existence of the creator is a perpetual indictment of the thief. Antisemitism, in this reading, wouldn't be just irrational hatred. It would also be, in part, the rage of the plagiarist facing the witness to their plagiarism.

It's a hypothesis. Not a thesis. I'm laying it down like a stone in a garden, to see if something grows beneath it.

## The Questions I Leave You With

If you see the same pattern I do — this cycle of intellectual theft followed by persecution — do you see other examples? Other cultural or intellectual traditions stolen from peoples you then sought to destroy?

And an even more unsettling question: is this mechanism reserved for the white, Christian, Western world? Or do we find the same pattern elsewhere?

Because there's a door I haven't yet opened. Islam, too, claims the Abrahamic heritage. The Quran recognizes Abraham, Moses, the Prophets — and reinterprets their message. Sufism shares with Kabbalah thought structures that are strikingly similar. *Hurufiyya* — the mysticism of letters in Islam — resembles Gematria like a younger sister. And Jerusalem, Islam's third holiest site, was Judaism's first holy place long before.

Is this appropriation? Shared heritage? Convergence? I don't know. But the question arises: does the millennia-old conflict between certain elites in the Muslim world and the Jewish people participate, at least in part, in the same mechanism — taking the inheritance, then contesting the legitimacy of the heir?

I pose the question without answering it. Because it's a neophyte's question, not an accusation. And because the history of Jewish-Muslim relations is as rich in peaceful coexistence (medieval Andalusia, Maimonides at Saladin's court) as in conflict. The picture is not simple. But the pattern deserves to be sought.

Or am I wrong across the board? Are the appropriations of Gematria isolated events, with no structural link, and is my tendency to see "roots" everywhere blinding me?

Tell me. The garden is large, and I don't claim to know all its plants.
